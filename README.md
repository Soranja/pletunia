- hero.order - make the button interactive: scroll to the postcards (later to the menu of products)
- FOR SPECIAL - add illumination trail for mouse (desktop)
- Footer - make the links clickable, news and about us - modals.
- Move the images and translations to the server side, create server.

- postcards.order - when clicked scroll to the form in the end and tick the corresponding item
- review order page
- capture form from input to TG
- review entire app

- postcards slider:
    - turn off the expansion temporarely?
    - when clicked 'add':
        - change the style + 'added' and keep the slider expanded (is it a good idea at all?)
        - arrow element that draws attention to the order form
        - the selected items are selected in the order form (redux?)
